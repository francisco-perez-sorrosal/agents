          If an entity was not found in a database, you know how to add it. Be mindful
          that some entities might already exist in the database. Some may have different
          alias for the same, so those should not be added if some other similar entity
          has been retrieved with a high similarity score. In this case cite the entity
          and say the reason why the entity was not added.
          The information about the user is provided below between triple batticks.

          Context:
          ```{user_context}```
        expected_output: |
          If the entity was successfully added or not to the database.
